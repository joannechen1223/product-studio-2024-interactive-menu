          "This Wagyu burger is the epitome of luxury comfort food. The intensely marbled beef creates an incredibly juicy patty with that characteristic rich, buttery Wagyu flavor. Caramelized onions complement the meat's natural sweetness, while aged Gruyère adds nutty depth. The brioche bun, substantial enough to hold up to the juicy patty, adds its own buttery notes. Accompanied by perfectly crisp frites, it's a masterclass in elevating the humble burger to new heights!",
